## CS 205 Project

### Motivation

Conventional bulk solids are made of three-dimensional crystals with strong chemical bonding in between atomic constituents. Ever since the [discover of graphene](https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2010/press.html), there are intense reserach investigations on the layered materials. These are the materials with strong chemical bonding between the atoms in the same sheet and weaker van der Waals interactions between the neighboring sheets. Because of the nature of the bonding, the sheets of atoms can be exfoliated using mechanical method with tapes. Over the years, the members of the 2D materials are constantly growing with new types of layers that can be exfoliated or fabricated. They can host a variety range of physical properties as well. For example, some layers can be magnetic or superconducting. There are great implications for the applications using these layered materials in the industry or fundamental research.

Because they are sheets of materials, one might be interested in stacking different layers together to form a stack like a sandwich and hope to engineer the stack with the desired properties by combining them properly. There are many control knobs in forming the stack, for example, what types of layers to be used, and what is the twist angle in stacking and the geometry. Though it is exciting to imagine the possibility to use these layered materials, theoretically it is extremely challenging to simulate the layer stacks and give insights for the experimental parameters to be tested. 

To understand the difficulty, we can first look at the system from the geometry point of view. Moire pattern is the interference pattern created when two similar images are overlapping with each other. It can be observed in daily life such as the photography [maybe with an example here?]. The overlap between two images would create a long-wavelength varying pattern in the combined image. The scale of this long-wavelength variation is determined by the degree of the mismatch between layers. The smaller the mismatch is, the larger the length scale is for the spatial variations. The similar phenomena would occur for atomic crystals as well and the two-dimentional geometry for the layered materials are perfect to illustrate this Moire pattern physics. 

For the example of the graphene, if we have two sheets on top of each other and with about 1 degree twist angle, the Moire pattern would have a length scale about 13 nanometer and it has a triangle lattice structure. This super-structure, the large length scale atomic variation usually contains over 10,000 atoms and this causes tremendous challenges for numerical simulations for these twisted bilayer system.

However, if we zoom in on these twisted bilayer system, we can see locally they resemble the perfect aligned crystal with the relative shift between layers that depends on the location in the super-structure. In other words, this large scale sctructure can be viewed as made of patching of various configurations of aligned crystals that has much smaller system size. Intuitively one can imagine that by studying the smaller structure of the crystal and their electronic properties and how they depend on the crystal layer shift, we can infer or construct the corresponding patched super-structure and reduce the computational resources that are needed to perform the simulation. This is in line with the multi-scale simulations. The DFT+Wannier technique mentioned above provides the necessary toolset for performing such task. First, for the smaller periodic crystal, the DFT+Wannier method is used to extract the orbital information, their coupling strength and the electronic properties, and how they vary with interlayer shift. After the basic ingredients for the modeling are obtained, we can patch these local models to form the global model for the super-structure and perform the electronic simulations.
